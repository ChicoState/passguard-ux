# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

  * Learned through creating personas how and what users would do with our application [Personas and Scenarios](personas/)
  * Looked at Google password manager as the main competitor they are well established
  * with Heuristic Evaluation determined Google password manager is well designed and does similar tasks
  * [Sketches and Diagrams](sketches/)

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

In Phase II we conducted cognitive walkthroughs and gathered informal feedback to evaluate the usability of our design and uncover new insights into user expectations. These evaluations
revealed that users prioritize **ease of navigation**,**clarity in data organization**, and **accessibility of stored information** as critical factors in the overall user experience. <br/>

The cognitive walkthroughs helped us identify specific areas where users encountered confusion or friction, most importantly in locating stored credentials and understanding the security workflow. The informal feedback gathered during the software engineering demo further highlighted concerns about the simplicity of task flows and visual clarity. <br/>
