# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

We are trying to find our main competitors and find out what they do not do so we can find our niche that we can fill with passguard.

## Methods

When making personas found out what users would want and need in a password manager 
I searched up the top password managers and looked at the lists of top password managers with lists including google password manager, NordVPN and a bunch more.
With Heuristics I looked more into google password manager since it is free.
The sketches we learned of how the layout would work best and have most of the features visible


## Findings

The Personas made it so how the app could be used and what would be wanted or needed within the application, such as ease of use, possibility of password leaks, and ways to store the passwords.
The heuristics showed that it would be a hard market to push our way into the market. Googles features are not only refined but are free. they also have a pretty robust system to handle many users and large amounts of data, but has most of the password manager features harder to find and not quite upfront about how to use it. 
The sketches showed us how we would like the features shown and layed out.

## Conclusions

The findings showed that it is going to be a hard market to break into and we have to find a strong niche to fit into that hasn't been overdone or that could compromise our security.
also about how we want out features to be easily accessable and to find out what the features can do.

## Caveats

The caveats are that most all of the other password managers are pay to use and we can't find out all of the features and how easier or difficult they are to use. A greater sample would do a great amount of help to refine our own app and understanding of layout and set up. Since Google is a search engine first email second and the password manager was made along the way until now, it makes it hard to truely compare their password manager to ours as it is quite a different focus.
