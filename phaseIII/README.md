# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In this phase, we transitioned from wireframes to a functional prototype, integrating core user features such as login, sign-up, and password strength feedback. Our primary goal was to observe how users interact with the live website and gather insights into the effectiveness of our current design. Through informal user testing and feedback analysis, we aimed to identify _usability issues_, _refine interactive elements_, and _further interface iterations_.

## Methods

To gather further insights about user behavior and interface usability, we conducted observational testing using a functional prototype based on the software team's web application. The following methods were used: **Task-Based Usability Testing**, **Pre-Test Survey**, **Post-Task Interview**, and **Thematic Observation**.

  During the **Task-Based Usability Testing**, participants were asked to complete specific tasks using our prototype. These tasks included: _adding a new password entry_, _using the password strength checker_, _generating a password_, _deleting a password_, and _copying a password_. We recorded the success or failure of each task and collected self-reported difficulty ratings on a scale from 1(very easy) to 10(very difficult). Participants were also prompted to explain why they found each task easy or difficult, offering qualitative insights into usability barriers.

Before beginning the tasks, participants completed a **Pre-Test Survey**, which gathered background information about their _Prior use of password managers_, _Experiences with password-related security issues_, and _Habits around password diversity_. These responses helped contextualize participant performance and attitudes during testing.

  After each task, we conducted **Post-Task Interviews**. Participants were asked _what parts of the website worked well_, _which features were strengths or weaknesses_, and _what they considered the best and worst parts of the interface_. This qualitative feedback helped identify interface elements that aligned or conflicted with user expectations and conventions

  Additionally, we applied **Thematic Observation** throughout the sessions. We took detailed notes on user behavior, paying special attention to moments when _users hesitated_, _misinterpreted icons_, or _navigated to the wrong area_. Notably, difficulty recognizing the delete icons and understanding the password strength indicators were recurring pain points. These observations were cross-referenced with post-task feedback to confirm and prioritize key usability issues.
  
## Findings

Participants generally completed the **Task-Based Usability Testing** successfully, but several usability issues emerged in Tasks 2 and 4. In **Task 2**, participants were tasked with checking the strength of their password; most users succeeded, however, some struggled to interpret the password strength icon. Symbols such as the shield and percentage circle were described as ambiguous or unclear.Â This suggests a need for more explicit labels or tooltip explanations for unfamiliar icons. **Task 4** tasked the user with deleting a password; this was the most challenging task. Two participants failed, and others reported moderate difficulty. The delete button was often misidentified or missed entirely, with users expecting a trash can icon instead of the current position. This reflects a user's need for standard visual metaphors aligned with common UI conventions. In the task where the participant needed to copy a password, **Task 5**, the participants performed well here, citing the familiarity of the copy symbol. Highlighting the value of using well-known UI patterns to reduce confusion.

The **Pre-Test Survey** showed us that the participants had ranged from password manager novices to daily users of tools like _Dashlane_, or _Google Password Manager_. The participants with experience navigated the website more confidently, but even experienced users faced challenges with non-standard icons, highlighting the importance of intuitive, universal design regardless of technical background. Several users also reported past data leaks or forgotten credentials. These concerns emphasize the need for clear trust signals, and explanations of security features.

The Participants expressed their thoughts, and processes after each task, we reported the results of our **Post-Task Interviews**. Participants expressed confusion over icons or felt that some features were hidden behind menus. One participant described the list containing the passwords as "a little overwhelming", suggesting a need for a more streamlined visual hierarchy and labeling clarity. Users praised the dashboard, and the simplicity of navigation, especially for adding and generating passwords, however multiple users commented on the overuse of blue, indicqating a possible need to diversify the color pallete to improve visual structure and readability.

While the users were working on their task, we took notes using the **Thematic Observation** research method. We noticed that Users frequently hesitated at icons without labels. Some participants clicked the wrong icon or areas due to visual emphasis on red or alert-like symbols, which unintentionally drew attention away from correct controls. The observations highlight the need for _icon clarity_, _feedback cues_, and possibly a _brief onboarding tooltip/guide_.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!! the test group is not representative of the whole user base.
