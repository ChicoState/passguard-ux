# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In this phase, we transitioned from wireframes to a functional prototype, integrating core user features such as login, sign-up, and password strength feedback. Our primary focus was to observe how users interact with the live website and gather insights into the effectiveness of our current design. By conducting informal user testing and analyzing feedback, we aimed to identify usability issues, refine interactive elements, and guide further interface iterations.

## Methods

To gather further insights about user behavior and interface usability, we conducted observational testing using a functional prototype based on the software team's web application. The following methods were used: **Task-Based Usability Testing**,**Think-Aloud Protocol**,**Observation and Note-Taking**, and **Post-Test Interviews**.

  In our **Task-Based Usability Testing**, participants were asked to complete specific tasks using our prototype. These tasks were: _Add a new password entry_,_Use the password strength checker_,_generate a password_,_Delete a password_,_Copy a password_. The success or failure of each task was recorded along with a self-reported difficulty rating on a scale from 1(very easy) to 10(very difficult).
  
## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!! the test group is not representative of the whole user base.
