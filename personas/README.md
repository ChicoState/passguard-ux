Grandpa Joe: 
Joe is 75 boomer, retired, lives with his wife, kids have moved away from their town for work and have kids of their own. His grandkids say he is not woak enough so he is going online more. He likes to learn and connect with people. He likes to be able to be independent and also likes to find local dance nights to take his wife to

# Scenarios

Grandpa Joe got a new tablet from his kids and grandkids to help with checking his bank accounts, facebook, and other accounts. He keeps asking his wife and his grandkids for the passwords he used for each account and gets confused on if he even made an account with certain sites or not. He tried putting post it notes around but his kids and grandkids reiterated that it was not safe, and they are worried about his cyber security. 
He could use Passguard, and our goal would be to help him keep his passwords all in one place so he can find them and easily log into his accounts without compromise.
