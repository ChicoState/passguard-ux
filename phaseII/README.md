# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

1. Cognitive Walkthrough<br/>
   Two users independently walked through our [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/jhDGKQwlUj8O7kmT1LcQr2/WireFrame_2?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=7lfkEIRinDBzvPLv-0). At each step of the walkthrough, users were instructed to:
      * List the steps they believe a typical user would take to complete a task.
      * Answer two questions:<br/>
            * **Will the user know what to do at this step?** <br/>
            * **If the user does the right thing, will they know that they did the right thing and are progressing toward the goal?** <br/>

   This feedback helped us identify where the interface was intuitive and where users may encounter some confusion.
2. Informal Feature Survey
   We also conducted an informal survey of the software class (approximately **n=35**), we asked:<br/>
   _"What features would you want in an app like this?"_ <br/>
   The insights acquired from this survey were used to guide our wireframe design and ensure that the app aligned with user needs.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

From our research methods, we were able to obtain key insights into user behavior, expectations, and interface clarity: <br/>

#**From the Cognitive Walkthrough** <br/>
   * **Missing Sign-Up Page Identified** <br/>
      Both users expected a sign-up option during the Walkthrough but they could not find one. This indicated that there is a critical usability gap, highlighting the assumption that account creation is a standard part of app interaction <br/>
      - _UX Insight_ : Users rely on conventional flows, absence of expected elements can cause uncertainty <br/>
      - _Design Recommendation_ : Ensure that assumptions are met, especially common assumptions like sigh-up/login <br/>

#**From Informal User Survey** <br/>
   * **Desire for Quick and Easy Access to Functions** <br/>
      - _UX Insight_ :
      - _Design Recommendation_ :
   * **Concern Over Forgetting The Master Password** <br/>
      - _UX Insight_ :
      - _Design Recommendation_ :
   * **Request for Copt Button Functionality** <br/>
      - _UX Insight_ :
      - _Design Recommendation_ :

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
