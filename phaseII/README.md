# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

1. Cognitive Walkthrough<br/>
   Two users independently walked through our [Figma wireframe](https://www.figma.com/design/jhDGKQwlUj8O7kmT1LcQr2/WireFrame_2?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=7lfkEIRinDBzvPLv-0). At each step of the walkthrough, users were instructed to:
      * List the steps they believe a typical user would take to complete a task.
      * Answer two questions:<br/>
            * **Will the user know what to do at this step?** <br/>
            * **If the user does the right thing, will they know that they did the right thing and are progressing toward the goal?** <br/>

   This feedback helped us identify where the interface was intuitive and where users may encounter some confusion.
2. Informal Feature Survey
   We also conducted an informal survey of the software class (approximately **n=35**), we asked:<br/>
   _"What features would you want in an app like this?"_ <br/>
   The insights acquired from this survey were used to guide our wireframe design, and ensure that the app aligned with user needs.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
